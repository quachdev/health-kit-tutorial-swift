# Health Kit Tutorial
This is an up to date tutorial from *Ray Wenderlich's* health kit tutorial found [here](https://www.raywenderlich.com/86336/ios-8-healthkit-swift-getting-started). 

This is the first part and only includes the `ProfileViewController` portion.  

### To get it to work
To work through this tutorial, you’ll need an active iOS developer account. Without one, you won’t be able to enable the HealthKit Capability and access the HealthKit Store.

The completed project requires modification before you can use it with HealthKit, as it’s set to a sample bundleID. You’ll need to set it up with a bundle ID of your own, select your Team, and then turn HealthKit OFF and ON under Capabilities of the target.
See the sections on Getting Started and Entitlements and Permissions above for more detailed instructions.
